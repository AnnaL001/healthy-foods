## Description

The Mobile Application is still in development. Currently, the existing features include form validation, capturing inputs such as the name of the user, their preferred diets and any allergies they might have and allowing users to search for recipes while taking into consideration their preferred diet and any allergies that they may have. Moreover, users can also view various meal types and their corresponding recipes, fetched via the Edamam API.
